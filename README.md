# CRM Data Cleaning & Analysis (Internship Project)

This project demonstrates the data cleaning, standardisation, and exploratory analysis workflow I used during my internship at a remittance and currency exchange company.

**All data used in this repository is anonymised or synthetic to protect company confidentiality.**

## Tools Used
- SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Excel
- Jupyter Notebook


## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to:
- practise cleaning and standardising CRM-style data
- prepare transaction data for analysis and reporting
- create derived fields to support grouping and trend analysis
- explore basic customer and currency transaction patterns
- demonstrate a simple SQL → Python analysis workflow


## Workflow
1. Wrote example SQL queries to demonstrate how CRM and transaction data would be queried from a relational database.
2. Loaded synthetic CRM-style CSV files to simulate extracted tables.
3. Cleaned and standardised data in Python (handling missing values, fixing data types, and creating derived fields).
4. Joined related tables to create an analysis-ready dataset.
5. Performed exploratory analysis using simple visualisations.
6. Exported a cleaned dataset for reuse or reporting.
