# CRM Data Cleaning & Analysis (Internship Project)

This project demonstrates the data cleaning, standardisation, and exploratory analysis workflow I used during my internship at a remittance and currency exchange company.

**All data used in this repository is anonymised or synthetic to protect company confidentiality.**

## Tools Used
- SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Excel
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to:
- clean and standardise CRM and transaction-style data
- improve data consistency and usability
- prepare datasets for reporting and further analysis
- practise end-to-end data operations workflows

## Workflow
1. Extracted customer and transaction data using SQL queries (example queries included).
2. Cleaned and standardised data using Python (handled missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats).
3. Performed exploratory analysis on customer activity and transaction volumes.
4. Prepared cleaned datasets for reporting and reuse.
5. Documented the workflow and findings in a Jupyter notebook.

## Notes
- This repository focuses on demonstrating workflow and methodology rather than real company data.
- The project reflects internship learning and skill development in data operations and analytics.
